# TowerDefense Game Project

The project implements a tower defense game in C++ with multiple classes like Tower, Enemy and Bullet, and addes icons and background music to make the game alive.

The player is given a certain amount of HP and coins in the beginning and needs to build and upgrade towers to stop the enemies from reaching the terminal. If an enemy reaches the terminal, the HP will be deducted, and the game will be lost if it's reduced to 0.

There are 3 levels with increasing difficulties. The player can choose which level to play at discretion.

The user needs to download [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) in order to run the code.
